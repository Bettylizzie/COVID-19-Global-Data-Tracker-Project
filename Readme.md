# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker Project

A Python-based data analysis and visualization tool that tracks and reports global COVID-19 trends using real-time data. This project was created as part of a plp week 8 assignment.

## Project Objectives

- Collect real-time COVID-19 data from reliable sources.
- Analyze global and country-specific pandemic trends.
- Create informative visualizations to show the impact of the virus.
- Generate summary reports and statistical overviews.
- Apply Python data science skills to a real-world problem.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Requests
